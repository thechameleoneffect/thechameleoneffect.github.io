We are using The\n                Chameleon Effect as a metaphor for the persistent focus on\n                singular population curricula in medical education. New programs\n                are being developed at medical institutions across the country\n                in order to combat health disparities and produce more\n                culturally competent medical professionals. Unfortunately, there\n                is a reproduction of non-inclusive disparity curricula as\n                institutions mimic the currently established structure of\n                singular population curricula. This initiative was developed as\n                a platform for open dialogue and to spark conversation on the\n                presence (or lack) of intersectionality in medicine.{' '}\n                <strong>\n                  We aim to start our own Chameleon Effect that leads to the\n                  systemic adoption of an intersectional lens as the foundation\n                  for medical curricula.\n                </strong>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </section>\n          <section id=\"two\">\n            <div className=\"inner\">\n              <header className=\"major\">\n                <h2>Meet the Team</h2>\n              </header>\n              <p>\n                <span className=\"image left\" style={{ boxShadow: 'none' }}>\n                  <figure>\n                    <img src={keely} alt=\"\" />\n                    {/* <figcaption style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>\n                      <strong>Keely (she/her)</strong>\n                    </figcaption> */}\n                  </figure>\n                </span>\n                <h3>Keely (she/her) </h3>\n                Keely graduated from Case Western Reserve University in 2019 and\n                2020 with her B.A./M.A. degrees in Political Science and\n                Bioethics and Medical Humanities, respectively.
