This may be attributed to the traditional\n            method of medical curricula that focuses on singular populations and\n            neglects the intersection of multiple identities in a historical,\n            structural, and cultural context.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Our team of three with backgrounds in bioethics, political science,\n            public health, social justice, and sociology have created this\n            project within the Intersectional Health Student Association (IHSA)\n            to shed light on health disparities across combinations of gender\n            identity, sexuality, race, age, socioeconomic status, and\n            disability, among other demographics. We invite you to use an\n            intersectional lens and conceptualize health inequities in health as\n            a social problem driven by a number of complex discriminations and\n            disadvantages.\n          </p>\n          <h4>\n            <i>The Case for Intersectionality in Medical Curricula</i>\n          </h4>\n          <p>\n            Intersectionality shows us that sex, gender, sexuality, race,\n            culture, and socioeconomic status, among others, are NOT mutually\n            exclusive. Despite this, medical curricula focus on single\n            populations, which casts a shadow on those who sit at the center of\n            multiple intersecting minority identities. There needs to be a\n            cultural shift among medical professionals regarding how we think\n            about health disparities.
